Bowling Green State University (Bowling Green, OH): Bowling Green State enjoys a great reputation for education, business, athletic training, and performing arts. It has also developed a new entrepreneurial program with seed business opportunities and one of the nation's best programs in college student personnel, which facilitates many extracurricular activities and encourages high participation/engagement rates among students.
University of Cincinnati (Cincinnati, OH): Currently experiencing a renaissance of sorts, U Cincinnati has undertaken new brick and mortar projects, including a fitness center, residence halls, a Greek village, a renovated football stadium, and a newly developed program to help at-risk students succeed. The area within walking distance of the university has been upgraded substantially, and U Cincinnati's graduation rate has increased significantly in recent years, as has its reputation for programs in the DAAP (Design, Art, Architectural, and Planning) School and the College Conservatory of Music.
University of Dayton (Dayton, OH): University of Dayton alumni consistently rate their undergraduate experience as positive and are very financially supportive, crediting their alma mater for their success. Current students are just as enthusiastic about the university. Students live in residence halls in the first two years and then branch out into university-owned houses in an adjacent residential neighborhood. Social life on campus tends to stay within this neighborhood, rather than migrating to bars and nightclubs. Additionally, there are any off-campus food choices that are supported on the student dining plan.
