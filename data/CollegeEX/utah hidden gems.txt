Snow College (Ephraim, UT): This is an unusual creature in the modern college world: A small, coeducational, public, residential, two-year, liberal arts college. It's very much of a small-town rural Utah location, but great access to outdoor opportunities and only about an hour and a half from Salt Lake City. Snow has a high-powered athletic program that competes at the highest levels of the NJCAA, and that most major college football and basketball coaches in the West know well. A wonderful place for the student who wants a genuine college experience, is ready to live away from home, but doesn't have or doesn't want to spend much money.
Utah State University (Logan, UT): About two hours north of Salt Lake City in the Cache Valley, this is an area of the state with incredibly rich outdoor opportunities. Its small-town setting and residential campus community set it apart from the University of Utah. USU has a great reputation in education and engineering, and the business school recently received a multi-million dollar gift. They are well known for their Aggie ice cream (they're the Aggies) that's made and sold on campus.
Westminster College (Salt Lake City, UT): This small, nurturing college boasts a healthy endowment, religious diversity, and an environment that's like a little piece of the East Coast in the heart of Salt Lake City. Westminster has a strong business program, a new building with an aviation program, and a fairly new financial services program. All business students are required to participate in some sort of internship or practical experience to graduate; internships for arts and science students are plentiful because of strong connections to the greater Salt Lake City community. Westminster is a fantastic little school for those who want something small in a manageable city as well as easy access to amazing outdoor recreation.
