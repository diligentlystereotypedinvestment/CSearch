Nevada State College (Henderson, NV): This four-year, public commuter college is located in Henderson, only 12 miles from downtown Las Vegas. The school is strong in the health professions (especially nursing), business, education, and the liberal arts and also provides extensive career counseling.
Sierra Nevada College (Incline Village, NV): This very small, private, four-year, residential liberal arts college is located on the beautiful north shore of Lake Tahoe. Boasting an 11:1 ratio of students to faculty, Sierra Nevada is a great school for outdoorsy students (especially skiers) and features robust programs in business, interdisciplinary studies, and visual and performing arts.
