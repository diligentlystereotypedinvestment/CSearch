Grand Canyon University (Phoenix, AZ): A Christian school in a suburb of Phoenix, Grand Canyon is a good fit for the student needing structure and extra support.
Northern Arizona University (Flagstaff, AZ): NAU is wonderful for the outdoorsy kid or "granola" types who are into natural foods, environmental issues; it has a nationally known school of forestry.
Prescott College (Prescott, AZ): This small college is just right for the strong individualist interested in ecology and environmental science. Prescott attracts independent thinkers, the kind of person who might go to St. John's College.
