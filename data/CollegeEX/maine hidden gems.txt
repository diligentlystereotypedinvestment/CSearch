Maine College of Art (Portland, ME): Small and intimate, this school draws quirky and independent students and gives them lots of attention while offering great breadth in art. Portland is a great small city on the Atlantic seacoast.
Maine Maritime Academy (Castine, ME): Compared with the rest of the maritime academies, MMA has great programs and great placement. Very structured and supportive, the academy has both regimented and nonregimented degrees and programs. The school is isolated and rural, on the tip of a peninsula at the head of Penobscot Bay.
University of New England (Biddeford, ME): A very supportive, career-focused school, UNE has schools of arts and sciences, health professions, osteopathic medicine, and pharmacy. Campuses are located in Biddeford and Portland.
